# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

**Objective**: Add commitlint and husky to the noir-hardhat-template repository to enforce conventional commit message standards through automated validation on commit-msg hooks.

**Context**: The noir-hardhat-template is a development template for integrating Noir circuits with Hardhat for Ethereum smart contract development. Currently, the repository lacks commit message standardization, which can lead to inconsistent git history and poor maintainability.

**Requirements**:
- Install and configure commitlint to enforce conventional commit standards
- Set up husky to run commitlint on commit-msg hook
- Ensure the setup works seamlessly with the existing yarn-based project structure
- Maintain compatibility with existing development workflow

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Considerations**:
1. **Package Manager**: The project uses yarn (version 1.22.22) as specified in package.json packageManager field
2. **Existing Setup**: The project already has a robust development setup with TypeScript, Hardhat, and various testing tools
3. **Git Hooks**: Need to ensure husky doesn't conflict with any existing git hooks
4. **Configuration**: Need to choose appropriate commitlint configuration that aligns with project standards

**Integration Points**:
- package.json devDependencies and scripts
- Git hooks via husky
- Potential .commitlintrc configuration file
- Documentation updates if needed

**Potential Challenges**:
- Ensuring yarn compatibility with husky installation
- Proper hook configuration for commit-msg validation
- Testing the setup to ensure it works correctly
- Avoiding conflicts with existing scripts or development workflow

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Setup and Installation
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Install commitlint dependencies (@commitlint/cli, @commitlint/config-conventional)
  - Success criteria: Dependencies added to package.json devDependencies
  - Verification: `yarn list` shows commitlint packages installed

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Install husky for git hooks management
  - Success criteria: Husky added to devDependencies and initialized
  - Verification: `.husky/` directory created with proper permissions

### Phase 2: Configuration
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Configure commitlint with conventional commits standard
  - Success criteria: .commitlintrc.js or similar config file created
  - Verification: commitlint can parse and validate commit messages

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Set up husky commit-msg hook to run commitlint
  - Success criteria: commit-msg hook file created in .husky directory
  - Verification: Hook executes commitlint when committing

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Test the setup with valid commit messages
  - Success criteria: Valid conventional commits are accepted
  - Verification: Commits with proper format (feat:, fix:, etc.) succeed

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Test the setup with invalid commit messages
  - Success criteria: Invalid commits are rejected with helpful error messages
  - Verification: Commits without proper format are blocked

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Update package.json scripts if needed
  - Success criteria: Any necessary scripts for manual linting added
  - Verification: Scripts run successfully

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Update README.md with commit message guidelines
  - Success criteria: Clear documentation on expected commit format
  - Verification: README contains conventional commit examples and guidelines

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Verify no breaking changes to existing workflow
  - Success criteria: All existing scripts still work
  - Verification: `yarn test`, `yarn compile`, etc. still function properly

## Project Status Board

### To Do
- [ ] Install commitlint and husky dependencies
- [ ] Configure commitlint with conventional commits
- [ ] Set up commit-msg hook
- [ ] Test commit message validation
- [ ] Update documentation

### In Progress
- [ ] Planning phase (current)

### Done
- [x] Project analysis and task breakdown

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Phase**: Planning
**Last Updated**: Initial planning session
**Next Steps**: Awaiting approval to proceed with Phase 1 - Setup and Installation

**Key Decisions Made**:
- Use @commitlint/config-conventional for standard conventional commit rules
- Use husky for git hook management (industry standard)
- Configure commit-msg hook specifically as requested
- Maintain yarn compatibility throughout setup

## Lessons

*This section will be populated with learnings during implementation*
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
